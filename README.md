# Frontend Challenge – Restaurant Review Mobile App

Welcome! This challenge is designed to evaluate your frontend skills using **React Native + TypeScript**, focusing on mobile UI patterns, state management, and API integration.

---

## Objective

Build a simple mobile app that connects to the Restaurant Review API, allowing users to browse restaurants, read reviews, and write basic reviews. Focus on clean mobile UI and proper data handling.

You are responsible for integrating with the backend API and creating a user-friendly mobile experience.

---

## Functional Requirements

- List restaurants with names, cuisine types, and average ratings
- View restaurant details with existing reviews
- Write and submit new reviews with 1-5 star ratings
- Search restaurants by name or cuisine type
- Simple navigation between screens

---

## Technical Expectations

- Use **React Native** with **TypeScript**
- You may use Expo or React Native CLI (your choice)
- Use **fetch** or **Axios** for API calls
- Style the interface however you like (NativeBase, styled-components, etc.)
- Organize code in a clean and modular way
- Include instructions in a `README.md` for running the app

---

## Notes

- You are free to mock the API response or integrate with the real backend if you prefer
- You're also free to define your own component structure and state management
- Think about UI/UX — prioritize readability, clarity, and responsiveness
- Clear code > Complete code

---

## Bonus Points

- Add AI-powered restaurant recommendations or reviews summary
- Add "Loading..." feedback while fetching data
- Auto-refresh data when app comes to foreground
- Use `AsyncStorage` for offline data persistence
- Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- Add dark mode toggle

1. Push your code to a **public GitHub repository**
2. Include instructions in a `README.md`
